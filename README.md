I'm a software engineer from the UK with a focus on web development, creative coding, and audio technology. I specialise in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, and C#, alongside experience in Shopify Liquid development. Beyond web applications, I work with digital instruments, plugins, and sound design, exploring interactive media with tools like TouchDesigner. Whether developing seamless user interfaces or building generative audio-visual experiences, I bring a technical and detail-driven approach to every project.
