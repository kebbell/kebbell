# Hi, I'm @kebbell!

I'm a frontend developer from the UK with a passion for crafting engaging web experiences. I specialize in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and have expertise in frameworks like React, Node.js, TypeScript, and C#. As a Shopify Liquid developer, I excel at building responsive, dynamic user interfaces tailored to unique business needs.

With hands-on experience in AJAX, JSON, API integration, and full-stack development, I deliver creative, robust solutions for every project. Whether it's modern frameworks or diving into new challenges, I’m ready to bring fresh energy to your ideas.
