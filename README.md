# Hi, I'm @kebbell!
I'm a frontend developer from the UK, I specialise in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and have experience with modern frameworks like React, Node.js, and TypeScript. I'm also a Shopify Liquid developer, skilled in building responsive, dynamic user interfaces. With hands-on experience in AJAX, JSON, API integration, and full-stack development, I bring creative, robust solutions to web projects.
