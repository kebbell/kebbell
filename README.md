# Hi, I'm @kebbell!

I'm from the UK, and my hobbies include digging records and following NFC. As a qualified frontend developer, I specialize in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and I'm passionate about creating engaging and dynamic user experiences. I'm always eager to learn new languages and technologies to enhance my skills and stay up-to-date with industry trends.

If you're working on some web development projects, let's team up. I'm excited about collaborating and building something awesome together. Feel free to reach out to me on GitHub: @kebbell.
