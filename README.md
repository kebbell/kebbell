#Hi, I'm @kebbell!
I’m a frontend developer from the UK with a deep passion for crate-digging records and following Norwich City FC. My expertise lies in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, but I also have substantial experience working with modern frameworks like React, Node.js, and TypeScript. I specialize in building intuitive, responsive user interfaces, and I’m always eager to dive deeper into emerging technologies like SASS, Vue, Angular, and jQuery.

With hands-on experience in AJAX, JSON, and API integration, I bring robust solutions to life, focusing on dynamic user experiences. Whether it’s crafting seamless front-end designs or working across the full JavaScript stack, I’m adaptable, enthusiastic, and committed to delivering quality code.

I’m always open to collaborating on exciting web development projects, sharing fresh ideas, and continuously refining my skills. Let’s create something exceptional together!
