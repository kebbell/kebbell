# Hi, I'm @kebbell!
I'm from the UK, and my hobbies include crate-digging for records and following Norwich City FC. As a frontend developer, I specialise in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS but also have experience working with React, Node.js, and TypeScript. I’m passionate about crafting intuitive, responsive user interfaces and always keen to expand my knowledge in modern frameworks and languages like SASS, Vue, and jQuery.

I’m always up for collaborating on exciting web development projects, bringing fresh ideas, and refining skills. If you’re looking for a developer who’s enthusiastic, adaptable, and committed to delivering quality work, let’s build something great together!

Feel free to connect with me. 
Looking forward to collaborating!
